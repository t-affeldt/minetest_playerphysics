# Player Physics API with Monoid Support
This is a patched version of the original [playerphysics](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Wuzzy/playerphysics/) mod.
Unlike the original, it is fully compatible with the [player_monoids](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Byakuren/player_monoids/) mod.

Both APIs act as compatibility layers for other mods to safely interact with physics while avoiding conflict.
By using this patched version, you can now use mods for both APIs in the same world.

Credit goes to Wuzzy for making this mod. I only patched it to work with player_monoids.
